## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a career switcher who got addicted to programming, and realized that life is too short to not follow your passion. Now I can't stop tinkering, tweaking, and learning. I have 2+ years of professional experience working as a full-stack engineer in fast-paced environments using the latest technologies (React, Next.js, TypeScript, Redux, Node.js, Python, FastAPI), and I'm dedicated to lifelong improvement of my craft.

Thank you for coming!
