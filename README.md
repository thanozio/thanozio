## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a career switcher who got addicted to programming, and realized that life is too short to not follow your passion. Now I can't stop tinkering, tweaking, and learning. I have 2+ years of professional experience working as a full-stack engineer in fast-paced environments.

I want to be part of a tight-knit team that will allow me to take initiatives and bravely impact software delivery.

If you value the craft let's keep in touch.
